However in practice, this is not necessary or even encouraged, especially if you want to reduce time and cost, or have few labeled data points.\n","\n","In this module, we will learn about transfer learning in NLP. In convolutional neural nets, backbones are generally trained using one task, then fine-tuned on another task. The same is generally true with transfer learning in NLP, except that language models are generally used to do pre-training, instead of classification on ImageNet.\n","\n","As humans, we have an incredible capability. We know tens of thousands of words in our head, sometimes in many different tenses, conjugations, etc. Given the sentence below, my guess is that you will easily be able to complete the sentence with a word that make sense given the context.\n","\n","It snowed on the slopes today, it was a great day for ...\n","\n","You probably easily filled that word with something like skiing, snowboarding, sledding, etc. In language modeling, this what we're trying to teach the model how to do. We use an unsupervised approach to learning a language dataset by trying to predict the next word in a sequence. Given a sequence of words, \\(w_1, w_2 ... w_n\\), we try to correctly classify \\(w_{n+1}\\).\n","\n","Today, we fine-tune a pre-trained language model from fastai, then use it to classify movie reviews by sentiment. We will be following the general procedure outlined by Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification (ULMFiT). A more detailed walkthrough of this procedure can be found in this chapter of the FastAI book chapter about transfer learning with RNNs. In FastAI, tokenization and numericalization are built in. Please see the book chapter linked for specifics on how it all works.\n","\n","The figure below is from the ULMFiT paper. This represents the training steps that they used to improve performance on text classification tasks using pre-training."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0he4_ImU0fys"},"source":["First, the authors trained a language model (AWD LSTM, the same one we'll use in this lesson, panel (a)). This model takes in a sequence of words as inputs and tries to predict the same sequence just shifted by one word (text generation). The input layer is an embedding, and the final layer is a linear classifier that predicts a probability distribution over the vocabulary for many times.\n","\n","Second, then fine-tuned that same language model on domain-specific datasets like IMDB (what we'll use today), and AG News (b).\n","\n","Finally, they removed the language model head and added an untrained classifier head (C). They trained the head only for a few epochs, then trained the entire model together. The authors found that this method significantly improved performance over untrained models.\n","\n","This technique is extremely useful because in NLP, unlabeled data is plentiful and cheap, but labeled data is scarce and expensive. This give us a ton of power to create classifiers for domain-specific datasets without having a ton of labeled examples.\n","\n","We will be replicating part of this work in today's lesson. We will load a language model that's already been trained on wikitext103 (We could train it ourselves, but this would take for ever). Then, we'll fine-tune the language model on movie reviews, including many that are unlabeled.
